The purpose of this module is to read a formatted file from standard input and change the values within the file.  The module takes two command line arguments, a string and a number.  If the string is found anywhere on a line of input, then the grade on that line should be changed to the number argument and the modified line should be printed to standard out.  Lines that don't match the string are printed back unchanged.
